                    <p>Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Anyone can paint. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.</p>
                    <p>We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them.</p>
                    <p>Just a little indication. Don't fiddle with it all day. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>
                    <p>Let your imagination be your guide. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just use the old one inch brush.</p>
                    <p>Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>
