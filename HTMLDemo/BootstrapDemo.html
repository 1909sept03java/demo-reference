                <p>We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them.</p>
                <p>Just a little indication. Don't fiddle with it all day. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>
